## Introduction
We solve this assignment with `pthread` library, so please test it with **Linux** environment.
* `prime.c` is our solution to Question 1.
* `fib.c` is our solution to Question 2.

## Usage
There is a Makefile in the directory. Simply use the command `make` to compile two C files. </br>
</br>
After two files are compiled, you will get two executables in the same directory with the source code. One will be `prime`, and the other will be `fib`. Then, you can use these two executables to verify the output.
