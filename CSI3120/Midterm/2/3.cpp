// (c) The pass-by-value approach will be easier to figure out. In this way, the value of the m and n will not change by the function h, so we don't need to track the changes made to the m and n inside the function h. However, the pass-by-reference way needs to track those changes.
// (d)Â No, here, call-by-need will not be more efficient. The parameters i and j must be accessed inside the function h. If call-by-need way is used, there will be more cost to access the i and j which will make the function h less efficient.
